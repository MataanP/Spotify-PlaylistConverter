Hello there!

To use this program, CD into the Downloaded directory.
From there you can run
    $python3 src/generic_server.py
Now in a web browser, direct to localhost:8000/login
Make an account or sign in
After signing in you should then be prompted to oauth into your spotify account

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can use my dummy account if you want

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;User = ThrowyAcc@gmail.com

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Password = jALcW3LiD6Ujw6snu3WRGQcRHCNkUL
    
Then you will have a chance to chose to make a parallel playlist from any of your
current playlists
If you do this, your account will have a playlist added to it that contains similar
music as the original (all from the same artists)
Then you can navigate to localhost:8000/home and get links to everyone who has used the service
From there you can look for playlists with parallel at the end of the name and
look at what the webapp has created!
