Hello there!

To use this program, CD into the PlaylistConverter directory.
From there you can run
  $python3 ServerCode/generic_server.py
Now in a web browser, go to localhost:8000/login
  Make an account or sign in
After signing in you should then be prompted to oauth into your spotify account,
  You can use my dummy if you want
    User = ThrowyAcc@gmail.com
    Password = jALcW3LiD6Ujw6snu3WRGQcRHCNkUL
Then you will have a chance to chose to make a parallel playlist from any of your
current playlists
If you do this, your account will have a playlist added to it that contains similar
music as the original (all from the same artists)
Then you can navigate to localhost:8000/home and get links to everyone who has used the service
From there you can look for playlists with parallel at the end of the name and
look at what the webapp has created!
